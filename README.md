# Hot Hand Fallacy Simulation

The foundational paper, “The Hot Hand in Basketball” by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky (Cognitive Psychology, 1985), challenges the belief that a player’s chances of making a shot increase after a hit or streak of hits. This project explores the statistical concept of the "hot hand fallacy" in basketball through Python-based simulations. By generating 10,000 sequences of basketball shots with a fixed success rate (31%), it calculates the probability of making a shot after three consecutive successes.

Key features include:

- Simulation Design: Generates large-scale random sequences to model basketball shooting patterns.
- Streak Analysis: Detects and analyzes streaks in the data, focusing on the probability of continuing a streak.
- Statistical Insights: Highlights interesting patterns through metrics such as means, quartiles, and standard deviations.
- Data Visualization: Uses matplotlib to create histograms, making it easier to interpret results.
